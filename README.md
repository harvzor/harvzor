- Scrobbler - [an API built with Rust](https://github.com/Harvzor/scrobbler-server), [an Arduino (ESP32) programmed with MicroPython](https://github.com/Harvzor/scrobbler-arduino) and [a UI built with TypeScript/React](https://github.com/Harvzor/scrobbler-ui), all for the purpose of tracking things (known as "scrobbling")
- [PhotoPrism Scripts](https://github.com/Harvzor/photoprism-scripts) - a bunch of scripts written in Node.js aimed at adding functionality that PhotoPrism should probably already have
- [Fitogram.Knowable](https://github.com/fitogram/Fitogram.Knowable) - a wrapper that allows C# enums to know if a value being serialised (likely sent from an external program) can be matched with an internal enum value, super useful for APIs and other JSON related things
